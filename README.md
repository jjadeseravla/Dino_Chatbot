# Dino Chatbot

Little Dino sits on the right hand side of your HTML page and stays there as you scroll away. You can have a little chat about life as you browse.
You can make him as clever or as dumb as you like.
(For ultimate stimulating conversation, you'd need to hook him up to an ai.API because he does not talk about much at the moment!)

## Future of Dino

Hopefully Dino will have a bright future, unlike actual dinosaurs!

- He should be able to disappear or appear when summoned.
- He could be animated, so when he replies his mouth could move.
- He needs to learn to have better conversations, and therefore needs to be hooked up to an API as I mentioned earlier.
